## TL;DR
This small and simple app can be used across devices, accessed anywhere with
an internet connection, and without any required installation.

## Use Case
The Decider was developed to help solve decision-making problems. In my case,
it's used to help me, and my (now) wife choose a movie to watch. She picks three,
I pick three, and we leave it to the decider to choose.

## How To Use
Go to the decider [here](http://www.archy.dev)
* Enter all of your choices into the first column/list.
* Press decide for a choice to be picked
* Optional next steps:
    * Move this choice to the shortlist
    * Repeat until you have three choices in the shortlist
    * Decide from this list for your final winner
